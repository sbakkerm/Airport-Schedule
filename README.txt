DESCRIPTION
-----------
The purpose of this project is to compute the number of gates needed to accommodate an airport fight schedule.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------
The program requires the header files `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `math.h`, `limits.h`, and `string.h` from the standard C library. 
The file `gates.c` must be complied and run in the terminal.

How open the terminal in Eclipse (make sure version is newest):

1. Right click on the name of the project in the project explorer
2. Left click "show in local terminal"
3. Left click "terminal"

An alternative method is to hold Ctrl+Alt+T in Windows.

How to compile the program: "gcc -o gates gates.c -lm". Note: "-lm" compiler flag is needed to use `math.h`. 

How to run program: "gates" for insertion sort, "gates heap" for heap sort, "gates merge" for merge sort.
